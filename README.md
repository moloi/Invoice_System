# Invoice_System
 DecoFurnSA Invoice Manager
# Overview 
The Invoice System is a C# console application that imports invoice data from a CSV file into a Microsoft SQL Server database. The application utilizes Entity Framework for data access and LINQ for data manipulation. It ensures that invoices and their corresponding lines are not duplicated in the database and provides logging and error handling for a robust user experience.
